**A Progressive Web App to track your dogs' meals and walks!**

- "Did the Boys Eat?" is a simple Progressive Web App (PWA) built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to track whether your dogs have had breakfast, lunch, supper, or a walk for each day. The app stores this information in a Google Cloud Firestore database and updates the buttons' styles accordingly. Say goodbye to guessing whether your furry friends have been fed or walked!
## Usage

- Click the buttons to indicate whether your dogs have eaten or been for a walk.
- The buttons will reset automatically at the beginning of each day.
- The app will sync data with Google Cloud Firestore to provide consistent information.
- The app will also force refresh when a change is made to ensure mobile users who added the site to their homescreen as an app will have up to date info.
